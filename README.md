# File-Compression-Algorithm

->A text data is taken as input.

*Our task is to provide security for the file by converting it into binary format by using the concept of Huffmann Encoding Algorithm.

*Then, this binary file is sent through network and recived by the receiver. 

*Now, we use Huffmann decoding Algorithm to retrieve the data from the compressed file.

*This program uses data structures like binary trees and priority queues to create Huffmann Table that contains binary codes for each character.
